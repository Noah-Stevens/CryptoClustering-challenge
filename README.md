# CryptoClustering-challenge
Module 19 Unsupervised Learning Challenge

All of work is in the starter code folder.

The assignment contains three parts:

  1. Scale the data
  2. Create elbow plots to determine the optimal value of k
  3. Create scatter plots of clusters using the optimal k value

This showcases my ability to create elbow plots to determine how my scatter plots are to be made, specifically with what number of cluster groups are optimal. Additionally, the file provides my knowledge on how full scaled data and PCA data differentiate.

The composite plot section for differentiation exhibits the ability to differentiate scaled and PCA data by the shown comparison of the elbow and scatter plots.

Thanks for reading! :))
